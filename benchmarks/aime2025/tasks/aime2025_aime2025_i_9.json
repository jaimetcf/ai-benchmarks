  "question": "The parabola with equation $y=x^{2}-4$ is rotated $60^{\\circ}$ counterclockwise around the origin. The unique point in the fourth quadrant where the original parabola and its image intersect has $y$-coordinate $\\frac{a-\\sqrt{b}}{c}$, where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are positive integers, and $a$ and $c$ are relatively prime. Find $a+b+c$.",
